**N’gine** is an open-source 2D game engine programmed in **C++** and inspired by the techniques of classic consoles. It is specially designed for creating games with a *pixel art* aesthetic, using tile-based backgrounds, *sprite-sheets*, and efficient resource management.

With over 6 years of development, it is in a stable phase, with the current focus on performance improvements and the implementation of new features.

## 🚀 Who is N'gine for?

N'gine is intended for anyone with a basic knowledge of object-oriented programming who wants to develop their own 2D video game. It was born as a custom tool for personal projects and as a foundation for the projects of first-year students at the institution where I teach.

## 💻 Supported Platforms

The engine currently runs and compiles on:
*   **Windows**
*   **Linux** (tested on Linux Mint)
*   **Raspberry Pi OS** (formerly Raspbian)
