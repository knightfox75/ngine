**N’gine** is an open-source 2D game development engine, written in **C++** and inspired by classic console techniques. It is specifically designed for creating games with *pixel art* aesthetics, utilizing tiled backgrounds, *sprite-sheets*, and efficient resource management.

With over 6 years of development, it is currently in a stable phase, with a focus on performance optimization and the addition of new features.

## 🚀 Who is N'gine for?

N'gine is intended for anyone with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) knowledge who wants to develop their own 2D video game. It was born as a bespoke tool for personal projects and as a foundation for first-year student projects at the institution where I teach.

## 💻 Supported Platforms

Currently, the engine runs and compiles on:
*   **Windows**
*   **Linux** (Tested on Linux Mint)
*   **Raspberry Pi OS**
*   **Anbernic RG35XX** (via Docker image)
